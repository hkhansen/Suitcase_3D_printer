# Suitcase 3D printer
This custom 3D printer is designed to fit in a small pelican suitcase from [Harald Nyborg](https://www.harald-nyborg.dk/mitsutomo-kuffert-111-x-192-x-232-mm).
All of the mechanical parts are either 3D printed or leftovers from an old Tevo Tarantula 3D printer.

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

**The following needs to be finished/implemented**
- Electronics need to be finished and a electronics box is needed.
- A power supply is needed.
- The Klipper firmware needs to be prepared on the controller.
